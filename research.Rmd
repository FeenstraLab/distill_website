## Areas of Focus  
The overarching goal of our research is to understand how genetic variation – small differences in our DNA – affect our health. Our research is focused on two main areas: pregnancy and selected diseases in young children. Preterm delivery and low birth weight can have detrimental effects on the health of a child. We study the influence of both the maternal and the fetal genome on when a child is born and how much it weighs at birth. The Danish National Birth Cohort is a central resource for these studies. Our second area of focus is selected diseases in young children, for which there is prior evidence that genetic factors play an important role. For these studies, we rely on information from Danish health registers (in the form of, e.g., diagnosis and surgery codes) to identify patients. We then retrieve biological specimens from the [Danish National Biobank](https://www.danishnationalbiobank.com/) for genotyping and sometimes other analyses. These resources allow us to conduct studies that would not be feasible anywhere else in the world.  


## Highlighted Research Projects  
### Genetics, metabolism, and the risk of two digestive system diseases in newborns  

Pyloric stenosis and Hirschsprung disease were both characterized by the Danish pediatrician Harald Hirschsprung in the late 19th century. In a series of studies, we investigate the genetic background of the two diseases of the gut and also analyze a number of metabolic markers using dried blood spot samples obtained a few days after birth. One notable finding is that genetic variants influencing blood cholesterol levels are also associated with the risk of pyloric stenosis. The project contributes with important new knowledge about the regulation of metabolism very early in life, and about how the risk of two serious digestive system diseases are affected.

### Genetic studies of pregnancy and birth  
Being born prematurely can have serious consequences for the health of a child. But what determines when a woman goes into labor, and why do some women deliver their babies several weeks before term? Environmental influences are important, but some of the answers also lie in the genetic variation among pregnant women and their unborn children. In collaboration with research groups in several other countries, we have analyzed the genomes of more than 40,000 women and 80,000 children. We have identified robust associations with common genetic variants affecting, e.g., the metabolism of the micronutrient selenium and the signaling between the fetus and the mother. Our genetic findings have prompted follow-up studies in cell lines to understand the molecular level mechanisms. Basic scientific knowledge from studies like these will eventually translate into improved prevention of preterm birth.

### Pregnancy

#### Babies' own genes influence when they are born
When a woman is pregnant, when she delivers is important to the health of herself and her child. Preterm birth is a major cause of health problems and is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. Conversely, if a pregnancy goes far past the due date, the risk of birth complications and stillbirth increases. But what determines when a woman goes into labor?  
In the study, the researchers started by analyzing genetic information from 84,689 children from 20 different cohorts in eight countries.
In a small area on chromosome 2, the researchers discovered a clear statistical association between common genetic variant in the babies and the timing of delivery.  
By looking at genetic variants in this area, the researchers discovered that the children could be divided into three groups that differed slightly in terms of their genetics. The children in the first group were, on average, born approximately nine hours earlier than the children in the second group, who themselves were born an average of nine hours earlier than the children in the third group.  
"The results cannot be used to predict time of delivery. The important message is that we have now established with great certainty that genetic variation at this particular place in the fetal genome has a biological effect on the duration of pregnancy, small as it may be. This new knowledge will be an important stepping stone in the efforts to better understand the biology behind how delivery is initiated," says Bjarke Feenstra.  
Biologically, this small area on chromosome 2 is particularly interesting as it harbors a group of genes of the so-called interleukin-1 family that produce inflammatory cytokines. In the days and hours leading up to delivery, these cytokines are known to play a central role in the activation of the uterus, detachment and rupturing of the fetal membranes, ripening of the cervix, and initiation of contractions.

#### High-fat marine diet has altered Greenlanders’ genes.
For thousands of years, Greenlanders have lived in isolation and have eaten a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. Researchers have discovered a gene variant carried by every person with solely Greenlandic ancestors. This gene variant has helped them to metabolize the fat from their diet. The CPT1A gene encodes for an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, which regulates the transport of fatty acids within mitochondria, the energy-producing centres in the cells. The rs80356779 variant in the indigenous Greenlanders changes only one of the 773 amino acids in the enzyme, but this still strongly influences metabolism.  
The gene variant was present in all the participants who solely had Greenlandic ancestors. The researchers did not find this gene variant in other population groups from Europe and China. A comparison of the frequency of the adjacent genetic variants in Greenlandic, European and Chinese populations confirmed that positive selection caused the variant.
