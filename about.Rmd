SSIâ€™s genetic epidemiology research is aimed at identifying genetic variants associated with health and disease and understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms. We thereby contribute to a strong foundation for subsequent translational research leading to improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment of patients.
