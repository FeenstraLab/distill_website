Hernias are characterized by protrusion of an organ or tissue through its surrounding cavity and often requires surgery. 

We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) scans on 65,492 cases of five different types of hernia and two combined groups against controls without a history of any hernia in UK Biobank data. The initial findings for inguinal hernia were followed up in 23,803 additional cases in cohorts from Finland, Estonia and Denmark.

Here's a summary of the study in [Danish](https://www.ssi.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/2022/statens-serum-institut-finder-sammenhaeng-mellem-brok-og-vores-gener) and [English.](https://en.ssi.dk/news/news/2022/ssi-study-identifies-more-than-80-genetic-loci-associated-with-herniation)
