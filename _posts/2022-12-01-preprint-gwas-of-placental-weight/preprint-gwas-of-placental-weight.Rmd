The placenta is a remarkable transient organ of pregnancy. With colleagues in the [Early Growth Genetics Consortium](http://egg-consortium.org/), we have conducted the first GWAS of placental weight. The manuscript [“Genome-wide association study of placental weight in 179,025 children and parents reveals distinct and shared genetic influences between placental and fetal growth”](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.25.22282723v1.full-text) is available in preprint.
